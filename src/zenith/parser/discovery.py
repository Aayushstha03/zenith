    A note named for a day is a log wherever it sits. One configured root does
    not describe a real vault: daily notes collect under `logs/`, under an
    archive, under a per-client folder. A note left standard is a note the
    parser never dates, and the answering model is then handed a result whose
    title reads `2026-08-20` next to a claim that the entry has no date. It
    resolves that contradiction by reading the date off the title, which is
    exactly the guess the dating rule exists to prevent.

    The Kanban root is checked first, so a board named for a date stays a
