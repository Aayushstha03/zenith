"""Deterministic, dependency-free token estimation for embedding budgets.

Parsing must stay hermetic: chunk boundaries decide entry identifiers, so they
cannot depend on whether a model has been downloaded. The parser therefore
estimates token cost with the WordPiece approximation below instead of loading
the real tokenizer.

The divisors are calibrated, not guessed. They were fitted against the pinned
tokenizer over the fixture vault plus English, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, and
Korean samples, and chosen as the loosest values that never under-count any of
them. Normal prose is over-counted by roughly two times, which is the safety
margin: a section splits a little earlier than a tokenizer-aware splitter would
rather than risk content being silently cut.

Deliberately adversarial input, such as a long random identifier or a base64
blob, still fragments faster than this estimate. That case is not silent:
`VaultParser` warns from its own estimate, and `LocalEncoders.truncated_inputs`
counts what the real tokenizer actually cut.
