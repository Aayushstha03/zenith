"""The labelled evidence one answering run has been shown.

A citation the model writes by hand is a citation it can get wrong. Assembling
a note title, a heading, and a line range into a template is three chances to
drift, and a small model takes them. So the model never writes a citation at
all. Every result a tool returns carries a short label, `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, and
the model cites the label. This module hands out those labels and turns them
back into the entry they stand for.

The ledger belongs to one run. Labels mean nothing outside the answer that was
built from them, so a new question starts a new ledger and counts from `s1`.
